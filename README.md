# MayaDrop
Mayadrop is a secure, peer-to-peer file sharing web app that works instantly in any browser — no installs, no accounts. It uses WebRTC for direct transfers over local networks (LAN or Wi-Fi) and can fall back to a relay or TURN server for wider connectivity. Files are sent device-to-device with end-to-end encryption, keeping your data private.

✨ Features
	•	🌍 Cross-platform: works on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android — just open a browser.
	•	⚡ Fast transfers: uses WebRTC for P2P; optional TURN/relay fallback for NAT/firewall traversal.
	•	🔒 Private & secure: no cloud storage, no accounts, no logs.
	•	🎯 Simple UX: drag-and-drop files, select a device, click Send.
	•	📡 LAN first: optimized for local network speed, can handle large files (GB+).
	•	🛠️ Docker ready: ships with docker-compose and coturn integration for production use.
	•	🎨 Tailwind UI: clean, mobile-friendly interface with modals and progress bars.
